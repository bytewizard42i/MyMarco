# The MyMarco App
### The MyMarco App is designed to be an app integrated with Google Assistant: 
It is designed to allow users to set up an account in the website which later can be accessed to
allow user or authorized agent to ping their phone to either send off an audible signal (even if the phone is on vibrate or mute)
or respond when the user calls out "MARCO!" it replies "POLO" and then 3 long tones. lol, or a snarky " I'm over here sir!" Like the time machine movie line.
Other possibly functionality includes turn the phone on if it is off, and geo location
as well as emergency kid finder, and police report emergency remotely.
